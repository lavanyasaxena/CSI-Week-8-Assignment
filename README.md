# *Summary*

### Predict the loan amount based on applicant’s demographic and financial details.
### Dataset includes variables like Gender, Married, Education, ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, Credit_History, and Property_Area.
### Target Variable: LoanAmount (continuous value) – suitable for regression modeling.
### Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and applied transformations like log scaling to normalize skewed data.
### Feature Engineering: Created new features like TotalIncome = ApplicantIncome + CoapplicantIncome for better prediction accuracy.
### Model Used: Trained regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor.
### Performance Metrics: Evaluated using R^2 Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
### Key Influencing Factors: ApplicantIncome, Credit_History, and Property_Area showed strong correlation with LoanAmount.
### Result: Best model achieved high prediction accuracy and generalized well across test data.
### Use Case: Helps banks and financial institutions automate loan price estimation based on applicant profiles.
